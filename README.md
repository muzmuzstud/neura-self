### Windows (PC)

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/routo-loop/neura-self
    cd neura-self
    ```

- **Requirement:** You must install the **Termux:API** app from F-Droid for mobile features to work.

---

## Configuration

NeuraSelf uses two main configuration files in the `config/` folder.

### 1. config/accounts.json (Multi-Account Setup)

This is where you define your accounts. You can add as many as you want!

**Template:**

```json
{
    "accounts": [
        {
            "token": "YOUR_FIRST_ACCOUNT_TOKEN",
            "channels": ["CHANNEL_ID_1", "CHANNEL_ID_2"],
            "enabled": true
        },
        {
            "token": "YOUR_SECOND_ACCOUNT_TOKEN",
            "channels": ["CHANNEL_ID_3", "CHANNEL_ID_4"],
            "enabled": true
        }
    ]
}
```

- **token**: Your Discord account token.

- **channels**: A list of Channel IDs to use. If you put multiple, the bot will rotate between them.
- **enabled**: Set to `true` to run this account, or `false` to skip it.

### 2. config/settings.json (Behavior)

This file controls the global settings for all bots.

- **Stealth**: Typing speed, mistake rates.
- **Cooldowns**: Custom delays between commands.
- **Features**: Enable/Disable Gem usage, Auto-Sell, etc.

---

## Dashboard

Once the bot is running, you can access the beautiful dashboard at:

**<http://localhost:8000>**

## Disclaimer

This tool is for **educational purposes only**. Using self-bots violates Discord's Terms of Service and may result in account termination.
